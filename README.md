# Battleship
A battleship game I made from scratch in JavaScript.<br>

This was a personal challenge for myself based on a class assignment. The assisgnment was quite basic, a matrix for loop with some astrisks inserted at fixed quordinates.<br> 
I got inspired and wanted more. I wanted better. So I made a version that will randomly place the ships in a larger matrix(grid).<br>

I did use some references like w3school, stack overflow, ect. but nothing was copied exactly.<br>


This code is run by using node command like this: node battleship1.js<br>
It should work in any terminal window; windows, your ide, ect;(I don't know about Linux systems) as long as you have node.js installed<br>


Play the game by inputting the letters a, b, c, d, e<br>
followed by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5<br>
EX: a1<br>
The game is unfinished so if any other characters, letters, or numbers are used, the game will break and you will have to exit the program and try again.<br>



future plans and/or updates:<br>


fully inegrate text filtering<br>
ships sized like the real battleship game (like how a carrier is five spaces)<br>
ships placed both vertically and horizontally with no overlap<br>
the computer will play against you<br>
